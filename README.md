      <h1>üí∞ ETH Hunter</h1>
      <p>Welcome to ETH Hunter, a polished and open-source desktop application built with Flutter. This tool is designed as a conceptual exploration of the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to scan for wallet addresses that contain a balance. It works by generating valid private keys, deriving their public addresses, and checking balances via the Infura API.</p>
      <p>The application is built for performance, using a separate Isolate for scanning to keep the UI perfectly smooth. It features multi-API key support, theme customization that syncs with your system's accent color, and automatic saving of any wallets found with a balance.</p>

## ‚ú® How to Use the App

The interface is designed for simplicity and power. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of all its features.

### 1. The Scan Page

This is the main control center for the application.

*   **Log Output:** The large central panel displays real-time logs of the scanning process. Each entry shows the scan number, current winner count, the wallet address, and its balance.
*   **Wallet Address:** Addresses with a balance are highlighted. You can click on any address to view it directly on Etherscan.
*   **Wallets to Scan:** Enter the total number of wallets you wish to scan in this session.
    *   Click the **‚àû button** to set the value to the maximum number of requests available based on your entered API keys.
*   **Start / Stop Scanning:** This button starts or stops the scanning process. The UI remains fully responsive while scanning occurs in the background.

### 2. The Settings Page

This tab allows you to configure the application's core settings.

*   **Theme:**
    *   **System:** Automatically syncs with your operating system's Light or Dark mode and uses your system's accent color.
    *   **Light / Dark:** Manually lock the theme to your preferred mode.
*   **Infura API Keys:**
    *   Add one or more of your free Infura API keys. The application will automatically cycle through them if one key reaches its request limit or encounters an error.
    *   Click the **+ button** to add a new key field and the **x button** to remove one.
    *   Click the **‚ìò icon** for a helpful guide on how to get your own API key.

    *   **Scanned:** A persistent counter of the total number of wallets scanned across all sessions.
    *   **Winners:** A persistent counter of the total number of wallets found with a balance.
