      <h1>üí∞ ETH Hunter</h1>
      <p>Welcome to ETH Hunter, a polished and open-source desktop application built with Flutter. This tool is designed as a conceptual exploration of the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to scan for wallet addresses that contain a balance. It works by generating valid private keys, deriving their public addresses, and checking balances via the Infura API.</p>
      <p>The application is built for performance, using a separate Isolate for scanning to keep the UI perfectly smooth. It features multi-API key support, theme customization that syncs with your system's accent color, and automatic saving of any wallets found with a balance.</p>

## ‚ú® How to Use the App

The interface is designed for simplicity and power. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of all its features.

### 1. The Scan Page

This is the main control center for the application.

*   **Log Output:** The large central panel displays real-time logs of the scanning process. Each entry shows the scan number, current winner count, the wallet address, and its balance.
*   **Wallet Address:** Addresses with a balance are highlighted. You can click on any address to view it directly on Etherscan.
*   **Wallets to Scan:** Enter the total number of wallets you wish to scan in this session.
    *   Click the **‚àû button** to set the value to the maximum number of requests available based on your entered API keys.
*   **Start / Stop Scanning:** This button starts or stops the scanning process. The UI remains fully responsive while scanning occurs in the background.

### 2. The Settings Page

This tab allows you to configure the application's core settings.

*   **Theme:**
    *   **System:** Automatically syncs with your operating system's Light or Dark mode and uses your system's accent color.
    *   **Light / Dark:** Manually lock the theme to your preferred mode.
*   **Infura API Keys:**
    *   Add one or more of your free Infura API keys. The application will automatically cycle through them if one key reaches its request limit or encounters an error.
    *   Click the **+ button** to add a new key field and the **x button** to remove one.
    *   Click the **‚ìò icon** for a helpful guide on how to get your own API key.

### 3. The About Page

This page contains information about the application, the developer, and how to donate.

*   **Update Checker:** The app automatically checks for new versions on startup. If an update is available, a "Download Update" button will appear, linking you directly to the latest release page on GitHub.
*   **Donation Addresses:** If you find the app useful, consider donating via the listed cryptocurrency addresses. Click the copy icon to easily copy an address.

### 4. The Sidebar

The sidebar provides navigation and at-a-glance statistics.

*   **Navigation:** Switch between the Scan, Settings, and About pages. The sidebar will collapse into an icon-only view on smaller window sizes.
*   **Stats Widget:**
    *   **Scanned:** A persistent counter of the total number of wallets scanned across all sessions.
    *   **Winners:** A persistent counter of the total number of wallets found with a balance.
    *   **Requests Left:** An estimate of the total remaining API requests for the current session across all your keys, visualized with a progress bar.

## üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers

This section provides a guide for developers who want to understand the codebase, build from source, or contribute to the project.

### Codebase Overview

The project is structured to separate concerns, making it easier to navigate and maintain.

*   **`lib/main.dart`**: The entry point of the application. It handles platform-specific initializations (like setting up the desktop window size) and launches the main `MyApp` widget.
*   **`lib/providers/app_provider.dart`**: This is the core state management hub, using `ChangeNotifier` from the Provider package. It manages the application's entire state, including theme settings, API key storage, scanning status, log entries, and update checks.
*   **`lib/services/scanner_isolate.dart`**: This file contains the high-performance scanning logic. The entire process runs inside a separate `Isolate` (a different thread) to ensure the UI remains smooth and responsive. It communicates with the `AppProvider` using a `SendPort` to send back logs, winners, and API usage stats.
*   **`lib/screens/`**: This directory holds the UI for each of the main views in the application.
    *   `main_layout.dart`: The main scaffold that contains the sidebar for desktop and the bottom navigation bar for mobile. It manages the page view and the animated background.
    *   `scan_page.dart`: The UI for the primary scanning interface.
    *   `settings_page.dart`: The UI for managing the theme and Infura API keys.
    *   `about_page.dart`: The UI containing app info, social links, and donation details.
*   **`lib/core/theme/`**: Contains the theme definition (`app_theme.dart`), which uses a custom `ThemeExtension` (`CustomColors`) to define a rich, accessible color palette for both light and dark modes.

### Building from Source

To build and run this project locally, you'll need the Flutter SDK installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IMROVOID/ETH-Hunter.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ETH-Hunter
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the App:**
    Connect a device or start an emulator, then run the build command for your desired platform:
    ```bash
    # To run on Windows desktop
    flutter run -d windows

    # To run on macOS desktop
    flutter run -d macos

    # To run on Linux desktop
    flutter run -d linux

    # To run on an Android device
    flutter run -d android
    ```

### Using the GitHub Actions Workflow for Releases

This repository includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and releases the application for all supported platforms.

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repository.

2.  **Enable Actions on Your Fork:**
    Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your forked repository. You may need to enable workflows if they are disabled on forks by default.

3.  **Make Your Changes:**
    Clone your forked repository, create a new branch, and make any code modifications you need.

4.  **Push a New Version Tag:**
    The workflow is triggered when you push a tag that starts with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.2`, `v1.1.0`). To do this:
    ```bash
    # Commit your changes first
    git commit -am "My new feature"
    git push origin main

    # Create and push a new tag
    git tag v1.0.2
    git push origin v1.0.2
    ```

5.  **Monitor the Workflow:**
    Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked repository. You will see the "Build & Release" workflow running. It will build the app for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, then create a new **draft release** on your repository's "Releases" page with all the compiled application files attached as artifacts.
